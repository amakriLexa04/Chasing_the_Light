So, they made a pact with the Wesfolk: their sorcerers would help them create an artifact of incredible power that
would grant the Dunefolk magical powers of Fire and help drive away the darkness. 
This artifact was created and named the Ruby of Fire, after the deity Dunefolk worship. It seemed to work as intended,
and people born in the kingdom started showing magical aptitude. But, as expected, the Wesfolk had deceived them, and
in reality, the artifact was "evil". It actually worked like a battery, using the souls of powerful mages trapped inside.
After death, the souls of all the Dunefolk mages would be drawn into the Ruby, remaining there forever to serve some evil plan of the Wesfolk.

Ruby could capture not only Dunefolk mages, but all human mages in general, that is, including Wesfolk themselves
and then Islefolk when Ruby arrived on Green Isle and they *somehow* learned magic. 

But Wesfolk would be fools to allow themselves to be so easily imprisoned in the Ruby, so they know the secret of
how to free someone's soul from it and put it in a new body (that is, they are able to be reborn even after complete
destruction, but only if the keeper of the Ruby, which, as we know from trow, was originally Caror, and then it became Lenvan, will allow it)
